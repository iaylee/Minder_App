## A Sticky Note Reminders Application

The sticky, sticky features:
- reminders ("remindable" on day it's due!)
- to do list
- mini games to keep your boredom at bay
- notes to write down your brillant ideas



Started this project for my grandfather who suffered two strokes several years apart. After the second stroke,
he could barely walk properly or remember his basic, daily routines such as brushing his teeth or taking his medication.

The program that I originally coded told him his morning routine in bright colours, so his attraction naturally 
was drawn to it. My grandmother helped him read the to-do list and he went through them one by one. In the evenings, 
his evening routines were shown and on days he had rehabilitation for his walking and reading comprehension, 
it offered encouraging messages and pictures of his favourite art pieces.
The routines were worded differently for each day of the week, so he could also practice his reading.

Similarly, in the future, I wish to code programs and create projects for the minority, 
the people whose needs are often different from the general population. 
I am aware that programs should be largely based for the majority and plan to 
balance that accordingly, but I want to also code for the people lying in the side 
lines, sometimes seen but unheard as their individual interests and needs differ too greatly to be 
lumped under the label of “general majority”.

Now that he has recovered quite significantly, I have adapted this project to appeal to 
a larger group of people, rather than an individual person, by combining features that I thought were 
useful together in a sticky note platform.

Enjoy!
